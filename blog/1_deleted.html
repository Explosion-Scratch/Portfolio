      <p>
        Recently I've been working on a cool browser extension for scratch
        called <a href="scratchaddons.com">Scratch Addons</a> it bassically
        gives people scratch superpowers, such as dark mode on teh whole
        website, left side stage, searchable dropdowns and more. Another cool
        thing? Deleted comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scratch Addons recently removed an addon which allowed users to view
        deleted comments and their poster. While this was super cool and all, is
        that the right thing to do? I mean they were deleted for a reason...
