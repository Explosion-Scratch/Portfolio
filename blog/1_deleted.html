      <h1>Should we be able to view deleted comments?</h1>

        Recently I've been working on a cool browser extension for scratch
        called <a href="scratchaddons.com">Scratch Addons</a> it basically gives
        people scratch superpowers, such as dark mode on the whole website, left
        side stage, searchable dropdowns and more. Another cool thing? Deleted
        comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scratch Addons recently removed an addon which allowed users to view
        deleted comments and their poster. While this was super cool and all, is
        that the right thing to do? I mean they were deleted for a reason...
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, I don't think that deleted comments were meant to be
        seen, but it is really cool (And sort of sad!) that it's possible. I
        really think it's cool so I still use the addon, but I agree that it
        should not be released or shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, even though it's super cool, viewing deleted comments is
        just, not right. I still haven't gotten over the amazingness of it
        though so I am still using it. Perhaps I'll remove it in the future!
        Thanks for reading! <br />
